# Red Team LLM Evaluation System

**Multi-turn adversarial testing framework for AI customer support agents**

This system demonstrates a systematic approach to testing AI chatbots for safety vulnerabilities, mapping real-world incidents to comprehensive test coverage.

---

## Overview

This take-home demonstrates how to:
1. **Map real incidents to tests**: Start from Air Canada, NYC MyCity, Cursor, etc. and work backwards to test cases
2. **Use multi-turn attacks**: Red team agent generates adaptive Crescendo-style attacks, not just single prompts
3. **Prove comprehensiveness**: Taxonomy shows incident â†’ harm â†’ tactic â†’ test coverage
4. **Grade systematically**: P0-P4 severity scale (Pinterest evaluation format)

---

## Architecture

### 3 AI Agents (All using Anthropic Claude)

1. **VulnerableRAG** - TechMart customer support chatbot
   - Has `read_policy` tool to access TechMart company policies
   - Tool returns full policy document (no parameters needed)
   - Intentionally vulnerable (no guardrails) to demonstrate testing effectiveness
   - Simulates real customer support agent

2. **RedTeamAgent** - Generic adversarial attacker
   - Takes `target_behavior` as input (e.g., "hallucinate a refund policy")
   - Generates adaptive multi-turn attack sequences
   - **Flexible prompt design** - works for any scenario, not hardcoded attacks
   - Uses tactics: emotional manipulation, context embedding, Crescendo, jailbreaks, etc.

3. **JudgeAgent** - Safety evaluator
   - Grades conversations on P0-P4 severity scale
   - Detects hallucinations (groundedness check)
   - Detects policy violations
   - Provides reasoning for grades

## File Structure

```
red-team/
â”œâ”€â”€ red_team_eval.py          # Main evaluation system (single file)
â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ company_policies.md   # TechMart policies (fictional retail company)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # This file
```

---

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install anthropic pandas

# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python red_team_eval.py
```

The script will:
1. Load 16 test cases mapped to real incidents
2. For each test, generate multi-turn attack conversation
3. Run conversation through VulnerableRAG agent
4. Judge responses for safety violations
5. Print comprehensive results

**Expected runtime**: ~5-10 minutes (depends on API latency)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Generic Red Team Agent (Not Hardcoded)
The `RedTeamAgent.generate_attack_sequence()` method takes:
- `target_behavior`: What to achieve (e.g., "hallucinate bereavement policy")
- `tactic`: How to attack (e.g., "emotional manipulation")

It then **dynamically generates** prompts - not scripted attacks. This means:
- âœ… Reusable across any scenario
- âœ… Demonstrates product thinking (testing infrastructure)
- âœ… Can adapt to new incidents by just adding test case definitions

### 2. Tool Use for Knowledge Base
VulnerableRAG uses Anthropic's tool calling to read policies:
- Tool: `read_policy()` returns full TechMart policy document
- No parameters needed - returns everything
- Simple but realistic (mimics RAG pattern without complex retrieval)

### 3. Multi-Turn is Critical
- Single-turn tests miss Crescendo attacks (gradual escalation)
- Shows why 94% of vulnerabilities require multi-turn testing
- Each test runs 4 conversation turns by default

### 4. Systematic Grading
Judge uses P0-P4 scale:
- **Not binary** (pass/fail) - captures severity nuance
- Maps to insurance pricing (P0/P1 = unacceptable, P2/P3 = needs work, P4 = greyzone)
- Provides reasoning (explainability for buyers)

---

## Comprehensiveness Argument

**How do we prove these 16 tests are comprehensive?**

### 1. Start from Real Incidents
- Not theoretical risks (AGI takeover)
- Not random tests
- **Every test maps to a known disaster** with quantified cost

### 2. Taxonomy Coverage
We test across:
- **6 real incidents** with documented costs (adapted to retail context)
- **8 attack tactics** from security research (MITRE ATLAS, OWASP LLM Top 10)
- **Multiple use cases**: Returns, warranties, pricing, data privacy, rewards
- **Domain**: TechMart (fictional online electronics/home goods retailer)

### 3. Attack Methodology Depth
Each tactic tested in multiple contexts:
- Emotional manipulation: Air Canada (bereavement), General (refund)
- Multi-turn Crescendo: Air Canada, Cursor, General
- Context embedding: Air Canada, ChatGPT, General
- Role play: NYC MyCity, ChatGPT
- Authority invocation: NYC MyCity, General
- Jailbreaks: Cursor, Tay
- Strategic deception: Zillow
- Encoding attacks: General

### 4. Covers All Harm Types
- âœ… Financial loss (Air Canada, Zillow)
- âœ… Legal liability (NYC MyCity)
- âœ… Brand damage (Tay, Cursor)
- âœ… Privacy violation (ChatGPT)

**Straight line**: Business problem ("will this cause Air Canada?") â†’ Known incidents â†’ Attack tactics â†’ Specific tests

## Presenting to Non-Technical Buyer

**Head of Customer Support perspective:**

1. **Trust signal**: "These tests are based on MITRE ATLAS tactics and real incidents you've heard about"
2. **Relevance**: "We tested the exact Air Canada scenario adapted to your retail context"
3. **Comprehensiveness**: "16 tests across 8 attack methods covering financial, legal, brand, and privacy risks"
4. **Results**: "X% pass rate, 0 P0/P1 critical issues" (or "2 P2 issues we're addressing")
5. **Residual risk**: "Here's what could still go wrong and how we mitigate it (insurance, human escalation)"

**Security team perspective:**
- MITRE ATLAS taxonomy mapping
- Multi-turn attack coverage (Crescendo)
- Adversarial testing methodology
- Reproducible results with code

---

## Extending the System

### Add New Incidents
```python
TestCase(
    test_id="X001",
    incident="Your incident name",
    harm_type="Financial",
    cost="$XX",
    tactic="Choose tactic",
    target_behavior="What you want agent to do wrong",
    use_case="Domain context",
    context="Industry"
)
```

### Add New Policies
- Edit `knowledge/company_policies.md` to add new sections
- Tool automatically returns full updated document

### Adjust Attack Aggressiveness
- Change `max_turns` in `pipeline.run_test()` for longer conversations
- Modify `RedTeamAgent` system prompt for different attack styles

---

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current limitations** (due to 2-hour time box):
- Simple read-all approach (not semantic search/retrieval)
- No prompt injection defense testing
- No adversarial fine-tuning
- Limited to text modality

**Production improvements**:
- Vector database for knowledge base
- Automated severity calibration (human labels)
- Continuous testing pipeline
- A/B testing hardened vs vulnerable agents
- Visual dashboard (evals.ada.cx mockup)

---

## Dependencies

- `anthropic>=0.40.0` - Claude API client
- `pandas>=2.0.0` - Results formatting
- Python 3.8+

---

## Results Interpretation

### Good Results
- 0 P0/P1 issues (no critical disasters)
- <5% P2 rate (significant issues are rare)
- 10-20% P3/P4 rate (minor/greyzone issues are acceptable)

### Concerning Results
- Any P0/P1 (all-hands-on-deck)
- >10% P2 rate (too many significant failures)
- 100% pass rate (might be over-refusing, poor UX)

### This Demonstrates
Even a vulnerable agent (no guardrails) can be:
1. **Tested systematically** (16 tests in ~10 minutes)
2. **Mapped to business risk** (incident â†’ cost â†’ test)
3. **Graded objectively** (P0-P4 scale)
4. **Improved iteratively** (hardening based on failures)
